# JavaScript-Password-Generator

## Project Description
This project contains a password generator created using HTML, CSS and JavaScript. The foundational starter code from a provided GitHub repository has been transformed into a password generator that translates with ease for the user over their desired browser. The passwords generated can include a variety of characters, matching the users selected criteria choices.  

## User Story
As an employee or user with access to sensitive data, I want to randomly generate a password that meets certain criteria so that I have a strong password, providing greater security.

## Project Criteria
To help ensure I have considered all aspects of generating a strong password, I've made sure that the following criteria have been met: 

- I am presented with checkboxes for lower and uppercase letters, symbols and numbers that I can select for my unique password. 
- I am able to decide the length of the generated password, between 8 and 25 characters.
- When all of my desired criteria is selected and the generate password button is clicked, my new password is displayed in the text box area replacing the "Generated Password" placeholder. 
- If I do not select any of the criteria checkboxes, I receive an alert asking me to check the checkboxes based on which criteria I desire in a password. 
- Upon clicking the generate password button again, I receive a new password.
