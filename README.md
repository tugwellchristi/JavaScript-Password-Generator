# JavaScript-Password-Generator

## Project Description
This project contains a password generator created using HTML, CSS and will function based on the JavaScript code written to it. The foundational starter code from a provided GitHub repository will transform into a password generator that translates with ease for the user on multiple screen sizes over their desired browser. The passwords generated can include a variety of special characters, match their selected criteria choices and character length.  

## User Story
As an employee or user with access to sensitive data, I want to randomly generate a password that meets certain criteria so that I can create a strong password that provides greater security.

## Project Criteria
To help ensure I have considered all aspects of generating a password with greater security, I've made sure that the following criteria have been met: 

- When clicking the button to generate a password, I am presented with a series of prompts for password criteria. 
- When prompted for password criteria, I select which criteria to include in the password. 
- When prompted for the length of the password, I choose a length of at least 8 characters and no more than 128 characters.
- When asked for character types to include in the password, I confirm whether or not to include lowercase, uppercase, numeric, and/or special characters. 
- When I answer each prompt, my input should be validated and at least one character type should be selected. 
- When all prompts are answered, a password is generated that matches the selected criteria. 
- When the password is generated, the password is either displayed in an alert or written to the page.
